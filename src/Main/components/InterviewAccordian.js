          In this course, we started from the basics of C programming, Data Structures, Algorithms and made the concepts very simple so that anyone with minimum or no prior knowledge also can understand, learn and master easily. This course covers algorithmic techniques for solving problems arising in the field of computer science. It is a mix of theory and practice. You will not only design algorithms and estimate their complexity, but also you will get a deeper understanding of algorithms by implementing them in the C Programming Language.
